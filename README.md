# blendergltf

### Installation

1. Download the [blendergltf ZIP file from GitHub](https://github.com/Kupoman/blendergltf/archive/master.zip).

2. Launch Blender, click `File -> User Preferences...`, and click the `Add-ons` tab
at the top of the User Preferences dialog.  Then, click the `Install from file...`
button in the bottom margin of that dialog.  Select your ZIP file to complete
the install.

3. In the left margin there is a `Supported Level` selector, click on the
`Testing` level.  If you have other testing addons installed, you may need
to enter `gltf` into the search box at the top of the left margin.

4. You should now see `Import-Export: glTF format` as a block in the body of the
preferences dialog.  Put a checkmark on this row to activate it.

5. Finally, click `Save User Settings` to keep the changes.  Note that any other
settings changes you have made to Blender may also be saved.

## Usage

Load a scene you wish to export to glTF, and click `File -> Export -> glTF (.gltf)`.
Some glTF export options will appear in the lower-left margin, and a file dialog
will ask for the location to save the exported file.
